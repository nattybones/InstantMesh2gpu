# InstantMesh2gpu - Everything below, but just split across two cuda GPUs

<div align="left">

Hello!  I am a non-programmer hobbiest that has wanted a text-to-3d-printing pipeline since fisrt getting stable diffusion to run on my home computer. I could not get InstantMesh to run on a single RTX 3090 GPU (24GB), so I asked Claude3 to rewrite the code to split functions across two GPUs.  Claude returned a working copy on the first shot (after I perfected the prompt).  I also have a version that supposedly increases the mesh output definition by 25%, but I am still testing.

Everything works the same as below, except you want to run 'app_2gpu.py' rather than 'app.py'

If you have any questions, I cannot stress enough that I largely have no idea what I'm doing.

My workflow was Automatic1111 ---> InstantMesh2gpu ---> Orcaslicer ---> Creality K1

The idea-to-object pipeline is open!

# ⚙️ Dependencies and Installation

We recommend using `Python>=3.10`, `PyTorch>=2.1.0`, and `CUDA>=12.1`.
```bash
conda create --name instantmesh python=3.10
conda activate instantmesh
pip install -U pip

# Ensure Ninja is installed
conda install Ninja

# Install the correct version of CUDA
conda install cuda -c nvidia/label/cuda-12.1.0

# Install PyTorch and xformers
# You may need to install another xformers version if you use a different PyTorch version
pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install xformers==0.0.22.post7

# For Linux users: Install Triton 
pip install triton

# For Windows users: Use the prebuilt version of Triton provided here:
pip install https://huggingface.co/r4ziel/xformers_pre_built/resolve/main/triton-2.0.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

# Install other requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 💫 How to Use

## Download the models

We provide 4 sparse-view reconstruction model variants and a customized Zero123++ UNet for white-background image generation in the [model card](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/InstantMesh).

Our inference script will download the models automatically. Alternatively, you can manually download the models and put them under the `ckpts/` directory.

By default, we use the `instant-mesh-large` reconstruction model variant.

## Start a local gradio demo

To start a gradio demo in your local machine, simply running:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Start a local gradio demo using 2 gpus

To start a gradio demo in your local machine using 2 cuda gpus, simply running:
```bash
python app_2gpu.py
``` 

## Running with command line

To generate 3D meshes from images via command line, simply running:
```bash
python run.py configs/instant-mesh-large.yaml examples/hatsune_miku.png --save_video
```

We use [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) to segment the foreground object. If the input image already has an alpha mask, please specify the `no_rembg` flag:
```bash
python run.py configs/instant-mesh-large.yaml examples/hatsune_miku.png --save_video --no_rembg
```

By default, our script exports a `.obj` mesh with vertex colors, please specify the `--export_texmap` flag if you hope to export a mesh with a texture map instead (this will cost longer time):
```bash
python run.py configs/instant-mesh-large.yaml examples/hatsune_miku.png --save_video --export_texmap
```

Please use a different `.yaml` config file in the [configs](./configs) directory if you hope to use other reconstruction model variants. For example, using the `instant-nerf-large` model for generation:
```bash
python run.py configs/instant-nerf-large.yaml examples/hatsune_miku.png --save_video
```
**Note:** When using the `NeRF` model variants for image-to-3D generation, exporting a mesh with texture map by specifying `--export_texmap` may cost long time in the UV unwarping step since the default iso-surface extraction resolution is `256`. You can set a lower iso-surface extraction resolution in the config file.

# 💻 Training

We provide our training code to facilitate future research. But we cannot provide the training dataset due to its size. Please refer to our [dataloader](src/data/objaverse.py) for more details.

To train the sparse-view reconstruction models, please run:
```bash
# Training on NeRF representation
python train.py --base configs/instant-nerf-large-train.yaml --gpus 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --num_nodes 1

# Training on Mesh representation
python train.py --base configs/instant-mesh-large-train.yaml --gpus 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --num_nodes 1
```
